# Logistic regression

Inspired by Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, I have implemented logistic regression using gradient descent. There are two versions, one of them has a regularization term with an
extra parameter input for lambda (a weighting for the regularization) while the other is the vanilla logistic regression.
